    <p>
        I really love <u>computers</u> because it is a modern and vast field.
        I like this science and I want to become an extremely professional
        <u>web designer</u> and <u>coder</u>.<br>
        I also want to work in the field of
        <u>artificial intelligence</u>.

        <strong><em><u><mark>FUN FACT:</mark></u></em></strong><br>
        Sometimes I truly feel hopeless, empty, and close to giving up.<br>
        But I know these moments are not signs of weakness;
        they are challenges meant to make me stronger.<br>
        Each one is shaping me into a brave, resilient, and future-oriented woman.<br>
        <mark>What I am facing is not a failure; it is proof of my inner strength.</mark>
